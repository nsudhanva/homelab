## Why Bare Metal Kubernetes?

Run a **production-ready Kubernetes cluster** on your own hardware. This project provides everything you need: Ansible automation, GitOps with ArgoCD, secure secrets management, and distributed storage with Longhorn.

<Aside type="tip">
Start with the local rehearsal flow if you want to validate every step before touching hardware.

## Features

<CardGrid stagger>
  <Card title="GitOps with ArgoCD" icon="github">
    Declarative cluster management using ApplicationSets. Push to Git, ArgoCD deploys infrastructure and apps.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Ansible Automation" icon="rocket">
    One-command provisioning with Ansible playbooks. Reproducible and version controlled.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Cilium CNI" icon="seti:graphql">
    Modern eBPF-based networking with Gateway API support via Envoy Gateway.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tailscale Ingress" icon="setting">
    Secure ingress through Tailscale with split-horizon DNS and ExternalDNS automation.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Vault Secrets" icon="approve-check">
